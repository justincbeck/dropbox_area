The best approach appears to be to place a rectangle R in to the bounding rectangle BR at the top left of BR and
continue inserting rectangles top to bottom and left to right, rotating as you go.

Best way to represent the bounding box?  Maybe a 2 dimensional array of booleans where true means the space is taken
and false means it's open and available.
